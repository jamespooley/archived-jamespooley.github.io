Howdy, there! I'm <span class="text-warning">James Pooley</span>
lead data scientist and manager at the digital marketing agency
[360i](https://360i.com/capabilities/analytics/)
in NYC. I work on a variety of data problems, projects, and products
with a strong econometric and operations research flavor and a bias towards
facilitating  business decision making.

I like person-level data, latent variables,
[Box's loop](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/papers/Blei2014b.pdf),
stochastic processes and applied probability, psychometrics, Python, R, [functional programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzUmK0Y07ck), the Unix philosophy, and Vim.
I'm also worried about the implications of person-level data and surveillance
capitalism, and know much less about every topic that interests me than I wish I knew.
My chief skill is [competence without comprehension](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/06/-a-perfect-and-beautiful-machine-what-darwins-theory-of-evolution-reveals-about-artificial-intelligence/258829/),
but I constantly work on improving the latter without losing sight of the former.

Away from the work, I stream [NTS Radio](https://www.nts.live) and read horror,
science, fantasy, and [weird](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780765333629) fiction. In terms of sounds, glitch trumps dub,
ambience trumps melody, humans talking trump humans singing, pitch-shifted voices trump
_voce veritas_ voices, and  rhythm typically trumps everything for me. And field
recordings: More of those, please.

I enthusiastically and with zero regrets spent a decent amount of money
to see [Aphex Twin's 2019 NYC show](https://www.artforum.com/music/sasha-frere-jones-on-aphex-twin-s-show-at-avant-gardener-79488) (the opening featuring [Tha2 \[world scam mix\]](https://soundcloud.com/user18081971/tha2-world-scam-mix)] alone was worth the cost of admission), (was in a crowd
that) got yelled at by Mark Leckey while sitting under
under the [Bridge@Eastham Rake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ-BhuuCIUE)
for failing to bring a level of noise sufficient to perform
an exorcism, survived [Sunn O)))](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyT4kJwn8G8)
at Knockdown Center, basked in the brilliant light and oceans of sound produced by Sunn O)))
at [Brooklyn Steel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCl1_fQy5Z8), and can be seen dancing
(poorly) in close proximity to Four Tet in
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWstd3jDZIs) video.

[My goal is to keep homeostasis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X1QkseVjIY&t),
which I hope feels like ["Everglade"](https://tortoise.bandcamp.com/track/everglade) sounds. Current situation is more like ["Rhubarb"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAoTsU7JlSI), so could be much worse.
