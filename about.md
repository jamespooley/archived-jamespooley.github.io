Howdy, there! I'm James Pooley, a data scientist and manager at [360i](https://360i.com/capabilities/analytics/) in NYC. I work on a variety of
data-related problems, projects, and products with a strong econometric flavor.

When not data sciencing in Python and R, I saw Aphex Twin's 2019 NYC show, survived the 2017 Sunn O))) show at Knockdown Center, and can
be seen dancing (poorly) in close proximity to
Four Tet in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWstd3jDZIs) video.
